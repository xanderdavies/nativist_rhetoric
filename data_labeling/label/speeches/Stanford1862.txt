While the settlement of our State is of the first importance, the character of those who shall become settlers is worthy of scarcely less consideration. To my mind it is clear that the settlement among us of an inferior race is to be discouraged by every legitimate means. Asia, with her numberless millions, sends to our shores the dregs of her population. Large numbers of this class are already here; and, unless we do something early to check their immigration, the question which of the two tides of immigration meeting upon the shores of the Pacific shall be turned back will be forced upon our consideration, when far more difficult than now of disposal. There can be doubt but that the presence of numbers among us of a degraded and distinct people must exercise a deleterious influence upon the superior race, and, to a certain extent, repel desirable immigration. It will afford me great pleasure to confer with the Legislature in any constitutional action, having for its object the impression of the immigration of the Asiatic races.
