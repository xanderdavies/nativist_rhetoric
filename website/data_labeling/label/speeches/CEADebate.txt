The Chinese are nothing but a pagan race....You cannot make good citizens of them; they do not learn the language of the country; and you can communicate with them only with the greatest difficulty, as their language is the most difficult of all those spoken; they even dig up their dead while decaying in their graves, strip the putrid flesh from the bones, and transport the bones back to China. They bring their clay and wooden gods with them. . . .Judging from the daily exhibition in our streets, and the well established repute among their females, virtue is an exception to the general rule. They buy and sell their women like cattle, and the trade is mostly for the purpose of prostitution. That is their character. You cannot make citizens of them.

[China is] a pagan nation [whose people] worship their god 'Josh,' a god made of wood. [If Chinese were granted full participation in American society] you may soon find established pagan institutions in our midst which may eventually supersede those Christian influences which have so long been the pride of our country.
